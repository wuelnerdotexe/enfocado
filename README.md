**Enfocado** is more than a theme, it is a concept of **"how themes should be"**, focusing on what is really important to developers: **the code and nothing else**.

What you **won't have** if you **don't install Enfocado**:

- **CIELAB Colors:** use of the well-founded Selenized black color scheme created with the magic of the **CIELAB color space**. Learn about its features and design in its [official repository](https://github.com/jan-warchol/selenized/blob/master/features-and-design.md).
- **Human Writing:** human writing is simulated by using italic typeface for syntax groups (comments, methods, titles and more ...) that are generally named and **written in human language**.
- **Minimal Syntax:** only three colors are used to highlight syntax, following the **color guidelines for web design**, which state that **only three main colors** should be used in interfaces, no more.
- **Signal Alerts:** the yellow, orange and red colors are reserved to be used only with important alerts, following the standards for the meanings of the **signal colors in the industrial area**.
- **Styles:** choose the style that best suits your **personality**:
  - **Nature:** go for the `nature` style if you are a minimalist developer who is always **connected to nature**.
  - **Neon:** go for the `neon` style if you are an outgoing developer that is always **surrounded by RGBs**.

In order for the human text simulation to work as it should, I recommend that you use either of these three beautiful fonts, which align with the **"Mankind and Machine"** concept.
